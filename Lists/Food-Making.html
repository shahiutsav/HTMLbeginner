        <p>
            <em>Homemade Bread </em>is one of my favorite foods of all time.
            There really is nothing quite like a warm slice of fresh bread served with a thick pat of butter on top. 
            Mmmmm! This recipe is perfect. 
            It’s simple to follow, takes about 2 hours to make and yields 2 loaves of wonderful bread. 
            It’s quite versatile too, so feel free to use part whole wheat flour if you’d like. 
            Brush butter on top when it’s out of the oven and partially cooled and everyone will thank you.

        <p>
            After cooling the bread, your reward's ready.
            I’ve found this recipe works really well in a bread machine! 
            I just had the halve the ingredients so it would fit.
